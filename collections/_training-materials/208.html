description: "Every fall the Associated Colleges of the Chicago Area (ACCA) computer science division offers a seminar series centered on a topic. This year the topic centered on the general topics of High Performance Computing and Parallel Thinking. Often, part of every series is a collection of webinars relevant to the topic. This year Shodor and Elmhurst College hosted, via Adobe Connect, 5 webinars (September 16, October 7/14/21/28, 2015) of one hour each to train students from ACCA on topics related to parallel computing, specifically focusing on programming technologies available on the Blue Waters supercomputer such as OpenMP, MPI, OpenACC, and CUDA. A forest fire simulation problem was used as a common theme and parallel algorithms were implemented using the above-mentioned parallel models of computations using C and related libraries.<br/><br/>Instructions for obtaining an education allocation on Blue Waters are available here: https://bluewaters.ncsa.illinois.edu/education-allocations"
