description: "Cornell Virtual Workshop<br/><br/>Prerequisites: MPI, OpenMP, Linux shell<br/><br/>In hybrid programming, the goal is to combine techniques from OpenMP and MPI to create a high-performance parallel code that is better tailored for the non-uniform and heterogeneous memory access characteristics of Stampede. To meet this goal, it is necessary to understand the effects of processor affinity and memory allocation policy, and to exert some control over them.<br/>"
