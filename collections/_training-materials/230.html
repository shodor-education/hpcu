description: "Across the United States teachers, parents, governments, and students are increasingly calling for computer science education to be made available across the K-12 curriculum. Working with a coalition of teachers, districts, and partner organizations, Code.org is helping to make this vision a reality. This endeavor began with a single viral video and the Hour of Code campaign which draws millions of students each year. Today Code.org has expanded their efforts to include the development of high quality curricula and classroom tools, ongoing professional learning for teachers, and outreach efforts to with school districts and the CS education community. As districts and teachers face the complex challenges of bringing CS to all students, Code.org is committed to being a consistent ally and advocate."
