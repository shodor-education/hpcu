description: "This is an excel worksheet that can be used to analyze strands of DNA based on their relative quantities of base pairs. Given a string of DNA, the worksheet will iterate over each value in the string and record the number of each base pair. Parameters in this model - Target and Target2 - determine which base pairs are being counted. The user can also set the inputs in the form of sequences of DNA base pairs to be analyzed. Multiple strings can be analyzed at once, allowing for easy comparison.
