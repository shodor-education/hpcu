description: "Modern multi-core CPUs provide a large number of compute cores per compute nodes in a shared memory setup. Making efficient use shared memory parallelism can be used to both improve resource use on a compute node and to relieve communication pressure caused by many independent MPI ranks sending or receiving data. This section will cover using OpenMP+MP hybrid programming to improve scalability of codes and provide pointer to the do's and dont's of hybrid programming. Level of material: Introductory."
