    contents: "<div class=\"reviewText\">This site contains some excellent interactive resources including a Jmol-based interface allowing interactive exploration in 3D of a collection of several dozen molecules meant to illustrate point group symmetries. There is also a Challenge page allowing users to follow a flow chart in order to zero in on the correct point group. There is excellent online help and curriculum for  teachers. </div><table  id=\"id8\">
