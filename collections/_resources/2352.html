description: "The mission of NCSA (the National Center for Supercomputing Applications) is to promote advances  across a broad range of fields of inquiry, from innovation in science and engineering to  breakthroughs in the social sciences to creativity in the arts and humanities. NCSA brings its expertise with high-performance computing, data management, scientific visualization, visual  data analysis, and other advanced IT technologies to bear on problems in the arts, architecture, agricultural engineering, aeronautics, and a host of other disciplines. 

Through its fellowship programs NCSA provides resources and support that enable scholars to pursue collaborative projects with scientists and computer technology experts at the center. 

Since 1999, these fellowships have allowed dozens of researchers to access and benefit from NCSA's high-performance computing and storage environment, cutting-edge visualization and
    virtual reality technologies, data mining capabilities, and opportunities for multidisciplinary
    collaboration. Thanks to these fellowships, researchers can combine their vision with NCSA's
    capabilities to tackle research problems and projects that would otherwise be out of reach. NCSA Fellowships frequently lead to long-term sustained collaborations spanning multiple years, enabling new and joint funding opportunities for both the faculty members and the NCSA staff. In addition, more than a dozen NCSA Fellows have the distinction of having their research recognized with CAREER awards from the U.S. federal agencies following their fellowships at NCSA."
