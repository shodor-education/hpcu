description: "Prerequisites: Parallel programming

Lustre is an object-based, parallel distributed file system that enables scaling to a large number of nodes (tens of thousands), petabytes (PB) of storage, and high aggregate throughput (hundreds of gigabytes per second). This tutorial describes how to use Lustre to achieve optimal I/O performance in a parallel programming application."
