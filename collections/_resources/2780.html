description: "Prerequisites: MPI Basics, C, Fortran

This module will introduce you to some of the advanced capabilities of MPI beyond ordinary message passing, including how to customize your environment in the following areas: derived datatypes; groups of processes and their associated communicators; virtual topologies among processes; and parallel I/O using MPI-IO. Application to specific architectures such as Stampede will be discussed."
