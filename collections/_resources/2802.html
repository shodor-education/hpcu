description: "Performance tools are software used to measure application performance usually with respect to execution time of all or portions of a code. These tools collect data from a running application that can be analyzed to determine if and where there are performance bottlenecks. There are a number of performance tools available ranging from simple utilities to sophisticated software with advanced visualization capabilities for data analysis. This tutoral provides an introduction to using performance tools and how to apply them to measure code performance."
