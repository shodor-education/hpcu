title: "PCI 2019 - Parallel I/0 Best Practices"
url: "https://youtu.be/cPbM7NkfoOU"
creator: "Robert Latham, Argonne National Laboratory"
description: "High-performance computing turns compute challenges into I/O challenges. In this talk we will survey the I/O libraries and tools available to computational scientists to effectively meet their data challenges. MPI-IO provides a foundation for higher-level libraries, so we'll spend a bit of time discussing the optimizations available. Then we will cover Parallel-NetCDF and HDF5, two of the more popular application-oriented libraries. Finally we will discuss the Darshan characterization tool to help make sense of what is going on behind the scenes with your application's I/O requests."
