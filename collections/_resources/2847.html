description: "This is a system model of the concentration of a drug in the bloodstream as a function of time and the doses. The user determines the dosage and doses per day, as well as the half-life of the drug and the blood volume of the patient. A graph shows the concentration of the drug in the body over the course of 48 hours as well as showing when the concentration exceeds the toxicity level or does not reach the medicinal level.
