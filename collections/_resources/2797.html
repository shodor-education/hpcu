description: "BigSim is a software infrastructure for whole-system simulation of a large parallel machine. It is designed to support early application development and identification of performance bottlenecks on a target machine that does not yet exist or has limited access. BigSim makes it easy to experiment with different parallelization strategies, so you can use it to develop, debug and tune, scale, and predict performance of your application prior to getting access to your target parallel machine. You can conduct simulations at varying levels of fidelity for both the computation and communication aspects in your application."
