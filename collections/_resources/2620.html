title: "Parallelization: Binary Tree Traversal"
resource-url: "http://www.shodor.org/petascale/materials/UPModules/Binary_Tree_Traversal/"
creator: "Aaron Weeden"
description: "This module teaches the use of binary trees to sort through large data sets, different traversal methods for binary trees, including parallel methods, and how to scale a binary tree traversal on multiple compute cores.  Upon completion of this module, students should be able to recognize the structure of a binary tree, employ different methods for traversing a binary tree, understand how to parallelize a binary tree traversal, and how to scale a binary tree traversal over multiple compute cores."
