title: "Monte Carlo Integrals Learning Scenario"

description: "This systems model estimates the value of an integral by finding the average value of a function over a specified domain. Upon user direction, the excel sheet will generate random numbers within the domain of the first quadrant of a unit circle. These numbers will then be used to find the average value of the function (y-value) and, after multiplying by four, provide an estimate for pi. From this model, students should learn how to calculate the value an integral without algorithmic methods, but rather with experimental and computational methods.
