description: "The Sociology 101 model focuses on the mood of people within a society. The population consists of two groups, the Passives and the Agressives, and people can switch between the two. While randomness essentially governs the variation within the model, variables also control how many citizens are passive and how many are aggressive. Based on user-set values, these variables can affect how many citizens wind up in each group. A graph displays the change in mood over time, which is a tool that could be useful for political leaders who wish to survey and respond to citizens' mood. Students using this model will be able to study and evaluate factors that decide a population's mood as well as discuss the applications and modern methods for determining it.
