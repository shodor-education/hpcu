description: "This teaching module continues with a demonstration of parallel and high-performance computing applied to the simulation of n-body system with a consideration of the issues that arise and approaches that are used to scale the such simulations.

An initial introduction into GalaxSee HPC is covered in part I of the GalaxSee HPC modules. Part II will focus on numerical issues related to solving the N-Body problem more efficiently, in particular the use of softened potentials in the force calculation, the use of tree-based methods such as the Barnes-Hut method, and the use of spectral methods such as the Particle-Mesh method. Some of the mathematics involved can be performed by a student with a solid basis in algebra; however the theory behind the Particle-Mesh method does assume some knowledge of partial differential equations and of the use of Fourier transforms to simplify the solution of PDEs with periodic boundary conditions."
