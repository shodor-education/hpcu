title: "Lab Exercise: Introduction to Parallel Computing Using the Bootable Cluster CD (BCCD)"
resource-url: "http://shodor.org/media/content//petascale/materials/general/exercises/NCSI_BCCD_lab_exercise.docx"
creator: "David Toth"
description: "This lab walks students through a step-by-step process of creating a compute cluster using the BCCD software.  It also shows how to run GalaxSee, one of the applications that comes with the BCCD software, and gives a lab exercise using GalaxSee to demonstrate some issues that arise in parallel computing, such as speedup and overhead.  Finally, the lab shows students how to copy code off a system running BCCD using a flash drive."
