PerfExpert is an easy to use profiling tool developed at TACC. This module shows how to use PerfExpert to obtain a concise assessment of a program's utilization of CPU resources by providing statistics on cache hits and misses, mis-predicted branches, FPU instructions, and more. In addition, PerfExpert is able to provide specific recommendations to improve an application's performance based upon its assessment."
