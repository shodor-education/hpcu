description: "This is a system model of the spread of disease in a population, which classifies people into three categories: susceptible (S), infected (I), and resistant (R). It tracks the proportion of the population that is infected by the disease on any given day. The infection rate, recovery rate, and time step are user-controlled parameters. By the end of the model, the disease has stopped spreading because there are no longer any infected people. A graph depicts the change in the number of people who are healthy (S), sick (I) and recovered (R) over the progression of the epidemic.
