description: "The IMAG was established by the Multi-Scale Modeling (MSM) Consortium, whose mission is to grow the field of multiscale modeling in biomedical, biological and behavioral systems, to promote multidisciplinary scientific collaboration among multiscale modelers, to encourage future generations of multiscale modelers, o move the field of biological computational modeling forward in the following disciplines, predictive models of biology, health and disease, bioenergy and bioremediation 
biomimetics, to develop accurate methods and algorithms to cross the interface between multiple spatiotemporal scales, to promote model sharing and the development of reusable multiscale models, and to disseminate the models and insights arrived from the models to the larger biomedical, biological, and behavioral research community"
