title: "Simulation Programming in Mathematica"
url: "http://leonia.zoology.washington.edu/Mathematica/MathTutorial/index.html"
creator: "Carl Bergstrom"
description: "The purpose of this tutorial is to provide a basic introduction to the use of Mathematica as a programming language for writing scientific simulations, with a particular focus on simulating stochastic processes. The tutorial assumes a basic familiarity with the use of Mathematica, including the basic syntax, graphics commands, and use of functions.  Some experience with a conventional \"procedural\" programming language, such as BASIC, Pascal, or C, is also assumed. Examples in Pascal or procedural \"pseudocode\" will be provided, to highlight the differences in programming philosophy and methodolgy between these languages and Mathematica."
