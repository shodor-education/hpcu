description: "This is a complicated model of the interactions between two populations - humans and mosquitoes. Each can live and die normally in isolation, but mosquitoes can also become infected with malaria, and then transmit that infection to their human victims. Depending on the initial settings, this can asymptotically approach a steady state or one or both populations can go to zero. Users can set the birth, death, and infection rates for humans and mosquitoes, as well as the recovery rate for humans.
