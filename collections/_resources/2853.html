description: "This is a system model of the different physical processes that water can go through. The model consists of a pan and water. It tracks the percentage of water that is in the pan, on the cover of the pan, and in the air around the pan. The percentages fluctuate due to the physical processes of evaporation, condensation, and precipitation. Parameters in the model - the physical processes mentioned earlier - determine the percentage of water at each location over time. When the model is run a graph is produced depicting the change in percentage of water at each location over the progression of the pan water cycle.
