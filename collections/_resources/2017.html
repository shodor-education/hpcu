    contents: "<div class=\"reviewText\">VisIt is a powerful 2D and 3D visualization and animation tool. Best of all, it is free and runs on multiple platforms (Windows, Linux, OSX). This resource points to the gallery where there are numerous examples of the applications capabilities. Perhaps this HPCU resource should point to the home page rather than the gallery.</div><table  id=\"id8\">
