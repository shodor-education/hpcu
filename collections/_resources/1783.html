description: "A variety of profiling and execution analysis tools exist for both serial and parallel programs. They range widely in usefulness and complexity. Most of the more sophisticated and useful tools have a learning curve associated with them and would deserve a full day tutorial themselves. The purpose of this tutorial is to briefly review a range of performance analysis tools, and to provide pointers for more information to many of these tools. 
Although a number of the tools reviewed are cross-platform, the emphasis of this tutorial is their usage on the IBM SP platform."
