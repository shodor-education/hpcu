creator: "J. Russell Manson"
description: "This module teaches the fundamental physical processes governing sand movement in rivers and how massive simulations can be achieved using supercomputers.  Upon completion of this module students should be able to implement a model for simulating these processes using C and visualize those simulations using Paraview."
