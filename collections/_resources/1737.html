description: "(from the course site) There are a large number of applications that use the TCP and UDP protocols for development. This tutorial focuses on these applications and covers the basics of getting them to work well on high-performance networks. Highlighted are the different parameters you need to consider when:

* Developing new applications to run on high performance networks.
* Existing applications are tuned to run with maximum efficiency when ported to a high performance backbone.

This course also introduces a small set of system tools available to test network domain parameters such as connectivity and bandwidth, as well as some tools developed at NLANR (e.g. IPERF) that are used to measure the \"jitters\" in the network."
