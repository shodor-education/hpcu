description: "Often there is a need to perform visualization on large number of files. We could create a VisIt session file on our personal computer then copy this session file to a cluster then point to the larger data on the cluster and render visualizations in batch. This process is not very intuitive and requires a bit of VisIt foo, so here is how to accomplish batch rendering on Stampede cluster at Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC)"
