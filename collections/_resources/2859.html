description: "This model is a graphing simulation with a function and variables that can be changed dynamically. Users may edit the value for each variable that plugs into the graphed equation and see its effect on the function's graph. The Simple Function model is a good introduction to algebraic concepts and the idea of a function. By comparing the variables' values and their role in the function itself, students will be able to see how each variable has an effect on the graphical trends of a function.
