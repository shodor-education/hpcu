description: "This tutorial provides a comprehensive introduction to using the Message Passing Interface (MPI). MPI is a a standard library of subroutines (Fortran) or function calls (C) used to implement the message-passing parallel programming model. MPI allows for the coordination of a program running as multiple processes in a distributed memory environment, yet is also flexible enough to be used in a shared memory system. The standardization of the MPI library enables source code portability and efficient implementations across a range of architectures."
