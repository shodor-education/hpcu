description: "The Message Passing Interface (MPI) has been the de facto standard for parallel programming for nearly two decades now, and knowledge of MPI is considered a pre-requisite for most people aiming for a career in parallel programming. This is a beginner-level tutorial aimed at introducing parallel programming with MPI. This tutorial will provide an overview of MPI, its offered features, current implementations of MPI, and its suitability for parallel computing environments. Together with a brief overview of MPI and its features the tutorial will also discuss good programming practices and issues to watch out for in MPI programming. Finally, several application case studies, including examples in nuclear physics, combustion, and quantum chemistry applications, and how they use MPI, will be shown."
