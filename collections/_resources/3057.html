description: "Discussions on unstructured mesh technologies. Discuss methods and the need by analysis code developers. Discuss core unstructured mesh components including parallel mesh infrastructures, mesh generation, adaptation, optimization fields, as well as solution transfer. Discuss dynamic load balancing, mesh/solver developments, and creation of parallel adaptive loops. Finally, it discusses an extendable mesh environment"
