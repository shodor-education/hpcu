    The George Michael Memorial HPC Fellowship Program honors exceptional Ph.D. students
    throughout the world with the focus areas of High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and
    Analysis. HPC covers the areas of computational sciences, computational engineering, and
    computer science using the most powerful computers available at a given time. The George Michael
    Memorial HPC Fellowship Program also supports the sponsors' long-standing commitment to
    workforce diversity and encourages nominations of women, minorities and all who contribute to
    diversity. 
  </p>
  <p>
    George Michael Memorial HPC Fellowships are awarded with a certificate and a stipend of at least
    $5,000 (US) for one academic year. All George Michael Memorial HPC Fellows are invited to attend
    at least one SC conference (usually the one after one year of receiving the award). Furthermore,
    the SC Steering Committee and other conference volunteers are willing to facilitate, where
    possible, internships for Fellows at HPC research or development sites. Interns are paid by
    their host site and will be subject to the prevailing terms and conditions of the internship
    program at that site. George Michael Memorial HPC Fellowships are awarded annually but previous
    awardees may compete annually to be renewed for up to two additional years (three total), based
    on the Award Recipient's continued exceptional academic standing, progress, achievement, and
    sustained interaction with the HPC technical community. All Fellowship Recipients pursuing an
    award renewal must be re-nominated to compete for an award renewal. A maximum of one nomination
    per academic department will be considered in addition to any renewal nominations from that
    department.
