description: "This is a simple system model that demonstrates passing on a recessive allele to one's offspring. Genotypes from parents are calculated via random numbers, which consequently determine the expression (or lack thereof) of the recessive allele in their kid. If, by random chance, both parents pass on the recessive allele, their kid will exhibit that recessive trait. This can be tied to the inheritance of recessive genetic disorders in real life. When one recessive trait is very rare, the chance of it being expressed is also rare, since the dominant allele will always \"hide\" the recessive. There are no inputs for this model, but it may be run multiple times to gain a better understanding of the concepts surrounding allelic patterns."
