description: "In this lab exercise, you will parallelize some simple algorithms using shared memory programming (OpenMP) and distributed memory programming (MPI) simultaneously. While the first two examples provide a simple introduction, the third one is concerned with the hybridization of a code for solving Poisson's equation on a 2D domain using Jacobi iteration. Your task is to experimentally investigate the performance of the hybrid code and compare it to pure OpenMP and MPI codes. If you are interested in a more advanced application, the NAS Parallel Benchmark (multi-zone) is provided in order to test a more advanced code. You will use Ferlin parallel system in these experiment."
