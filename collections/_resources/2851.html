title: "Learning Scenario - Nutria (Vensim)"
url: "http://shodor.org/talks-new/vensim/nutria/learningScenarioWeb/"
creator: "NCSI"
description: "This is a simple system model of exponential population growth, with an added parameter that determines carrying capacity. The population in this case consists of Nutria, a species of aquatic rodent, reproduces based on its birth rate and dies based on its death rate. The competition factor then determines to what degree death rates are determined by population. This simulates the effect of competition over limited resources and effectively limits the population.
