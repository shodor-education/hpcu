description: "This model is an implementation of Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton designed with extremely simple rules that produce surprisingly complex results. The user can choose the initial density of the cells in the game and whether the board is an island or a torus (see How to Use). Then the user runs the game to see the chaos that ensues. The model also includes scratch space for users who would like to create their own initial cell configurations for the game.
