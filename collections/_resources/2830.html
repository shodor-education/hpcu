description: "This is a simple system model of exponential population growth. The population starts at a certain level, then after each time tick, it increases by a set proportion of its current value. The result of which is an exponentially increasing population. Users can set the initial population, the amount of time for which the simulation is run, the length of a time tick, and the proportion of individuals who reproduce after each tick.
