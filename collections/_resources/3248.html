creator:
  - "Brandon Barker, Cornell Center for Advanced Computing"
description: "This module is intended to insure that all users have the basic knowledge to use Comet efficiently. It contains the information needed to access the system, transfer data and code to the system, compile/link code, and submit jobs to the batch system. It also covers several examples that are well suited as Comet use cases."
