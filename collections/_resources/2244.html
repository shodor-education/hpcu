description: "This module introduces the N-body problem, which seeks to account for the dynamics of systems of multiple interacting objects. Galaxy dynamics serves as the motivating example to introduce a variety of computational methods for simulating change and criteria that can be used to check for model accuracy. Finally, the basic issues and ideas that must be considered when developing a parallel implementation of the simulation are introduced."
