***Notice to NMPDR Users***

The NMPDR BRC contract ended in December 2009. At that time we ceased maintenance of the NMPDR web resource and data. The PATRIC team, located at the Virginia Bioinformatics Institute, created and maintains a new consolidated BRC for all of the NIAID category A-C priority pathogenic bacteria. NMPDR is transferring data and software associated to PATRIC for incorporation into their new Web-based bioinformatics resource. Please feel free to contact us if you have any questions about this transition."
