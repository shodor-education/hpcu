description: "Prerequisites: Batch Submission, C, Fortran

Vectorization is a process by which mathematical operations found in tight loops in scientific code are executed in parallel on special vector hardware found in CPUs and coprocessors. This module describes the vectorization process as it relates to computing hardware, compilers, and coding practices."
