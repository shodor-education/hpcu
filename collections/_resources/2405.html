title: "Blue Waters Petascale Workshop Series - Fault Tolerance for Extreme-Scale Computing Workshop"
resource-url: "http://www.teragridforum.org/mediawiki/index.php?title=2009_Fault_Tolerance_Workshop"
description: "The purpose of this workshop is to discuss fault-tolerance (FT) on large systems for running large, possibly long-running applications. The main point of the workshop is to have systems people, middleware people (include FT experts), and apps people talk about the issues and figure out what needs to be done, mostly at the middleware and app levels, to run such apps on the coming petascale systems, without having faults that cause large numbers of application failures. The workshop was held during March 19-20, 2009."
