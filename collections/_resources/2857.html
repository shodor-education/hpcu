description: "This model represents a two-stage reversible reaction. Many organic processes operate in which the reaction can both transform reactants to products, and products back to reactants. In such a scenario, rather than going to completion the reaction will reach equilibrium. There are three stages in the reaction, represented by groups A, B, and C. As time goes by, A transforms to B, and B to C, and upon equilibrium the reverse can also occur
