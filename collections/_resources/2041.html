    <b>Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory Internships</b> -- The Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) hosts 300 to 400 undergraduate and
    graduate students and some faculty every summer in support of its world-class scientific
    facilities and staff and in an effort to help train the nation's next generation of scientists
    and engineers. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Involvement in world-class research provides participants with a set of experiences that support
    their education and career goals. Typically, participants gain hands-on experience and the
    opportunity to apply learned theory to real life problems. An experience of this type, and with
    these resources at a premier state-of-the-art research laboratory is not available in an
    academic research lab.
