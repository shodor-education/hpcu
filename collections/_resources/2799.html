description: "This tutorial covers intermediate-level topics in MPI derived from questions asked by students during face-to-face introductory MPI training courses. These topics are just beyond the difficulty level of an introductory course. Each topic addresses why you might want to use a particular technique, discusses the MPI routines used, and provides sample codes to demonstrate the technique."
