creator: "John E. Stone, UIUC"
description: "An in-depth introduction to the CUDA programming model, key abstractions and terminology. Including, but not limited to: CUDA thread model, kernels, and resource management CUDA parallelism with grids/blocks/warps/threads and divergence, shared memory, bank conflicts, global memory, GPU occupancy, register usage, launch configurations, and other kernel tuning concepts."
