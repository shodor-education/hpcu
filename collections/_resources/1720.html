title: "GridShib: An Attribute-Based Authorization Framework"
url: "http://gridshib.globus.org/"
description: "Note that the GridShib project has reached the end of it's original life, however some of the software lives on:

    * The GridShib CA issues certificates based on Shibboleth authentication. The GridShib CA is now supported by the CILogon Project.

The following software is used by the TeraGrid Science Gateways program and is supported solely for that purpose. New adoption is not encouraged due to the Globus Project discontinuing development of the Java-based web services.

    * The GridShib SAML Tools bind SAML V1.1 assertions to RFC 3820 proxy certificates. The SAML Tools are used by the TeraGrid Science Gateways program and supported for that purpose.
    * GridShib for Globus Toolkit performs SAML-based authorization for Globus Toolkit 4.0 Java-based web services.

The following GridShib software is no longer supported:

    * GridShib for Shibboleth provides software plugins for the Shibboleth 2.0 Identity Provider (IdP) that implement the SAML V2.0 Holder-of-Key Web Browser SSO Profile."
