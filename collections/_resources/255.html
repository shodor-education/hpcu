description: "Physlets are small, flexible Java applets that can be used in a wide variety of web applications. Physlets can be used as an element of almost any curriculum with almost any teaching style.  Although we believe that interactive engagement methods such as Just-in-Time Teaching, Peer Instruction, or Tutorials can improve pedagogy, Physlets can be used as traditional lecture demonstrations and can be given as end-of-chapter homework."
