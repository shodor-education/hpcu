resource-url: "http://shodor.org/petascale/materials/UPModules/populationMatrices/"
description: "Many computational science models involve matrices. This module will provide a foundation for understanding matrices and some of their operations with examples from population dynamics and will provide background material for other computational science modules. The module will also have a discussion of the importance of matrices in many models that employ high performance computing. The model will have two accompanying tutorials. One will include some of the basics of MPI. The other will provide an introduction to matrices in Mathematica along with Grid Mathematica."
