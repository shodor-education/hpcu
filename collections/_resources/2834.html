title: "Salt Diffusion Learning Scenario"

creator:

description: "This is a system model of salt diffusion in water. Each of the cells starts with a certain concentration of salt, and then changes its concentration each time step based on the concentration of salt in all adjacent cells. Because the outer edge of the cellblock is considered permanently zero (representing a large body of water), salt will slowly diffuse down to zero, beginning at the edges and progressing into the middle. Users can set the initial concentration, and then step through the simulation.
