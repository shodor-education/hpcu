description: "TACC<br/><br/>Prerequisites: Linux, C/Fortran/Python, HPC Cluster Programming Environement<br/><br/>This one day workshop will introduce participants to the four data intensive computing modes Stampede is designed to provide: 1) high throughput data processing, 2) parallel data analysis, 3) large shared memory applications, and 4) large-scale visualization.  The material will focus on using the job launchers, parallel R, and visualization tools available on Stampede. The workshop will use a mixture of lecture and hands-on training to explore how users can use Stampede for their data driven computing needs.<br/>"
