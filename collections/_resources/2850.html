description: "This is a system model of an enzyme reaction. In this reaction, each reactant molecule must bind to an enzyme molecule in order to become a product. Enzymes can only bind to one reactant at a time and take a fixed amount of time to convert it to a product, so the concentration of enzymes is the limiting factor for the reaction. The transformations of reactant and enzyme into enzyme-reactant complex, and enzyme-reactant complex into enzyme and product, are defined by the Michaelis-Menton equation. Parameters in this model determine the inputs to the equation, which in turn determine the rate of the reaction.
