description: "Docker and Singularity are a products for delivering container solutions. Containers help in standardizing the process of packaging software and the associated dependencies such that the issues related to the differences in environment (e.g., different versions of the libraries) during the development and release phases of a software can be mitigated. In doing so, Containers simplify the software installation processes by providing an easy way to share working environments, which in turn makes it easy to use libraries with complicated setups. Distributing a Docker or Singularity image means distributing both the code itself as well as the environment used to run that code allowing images to run identically on OSX, Windows, and Linux, so generated analyses will run on any other machine and will have reproducible results."
