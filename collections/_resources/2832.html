title: "Pseudo Random Numbers Learning Scenario"

description: "Random numbers on computers are almost never "true" random numbers. That is, since the computer calculates its random numbers through a series of algorithms, even if it is hard to detect a pattern, the numbers are not genuinely random. This model allows for students to explore what is known as "pseudo random numbers" and the algorithms that run behind such calculations. Through a series of shifts, multipliers, and other calculations, random numbers are generated and used to estimate the area under a curve. The integral calculated in this model is the area of the unit circle, equal to pi. Many trials yield a more accurate result, as the Law of Large Numbers states, so the model takes into account increasing amounts of random numbers to calculate pi.
