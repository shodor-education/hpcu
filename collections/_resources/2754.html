description: "There are a number of utilities available to accomplish the essential task of transferring data and/or code between the file system on your workstation and a larger computing resource. The one you choose depends on the size and number of files to be transferred as well as the ease of invoking the utility, and the ability to use a script. This module presents the various options and the pros and cons of each of them as well as ways to make these transfers faster."
