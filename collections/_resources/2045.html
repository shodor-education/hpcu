title: "Blue Waters Call for Undergraduate Student Applications for Internships"
resource-url: "http://www.computationalscience.org/upep"
description: "<p>
   The NCSA Blue Waters project, in collaboration with the National Computational Science
    Institute (NCSI) and national HPC programs, is launching a coordinated effort to prepare current
    and future generations of students with the computational thinking skills, knowledge and
    commitment to advance scientific computing through the use of high performance computing (HPC)
    resources and environments. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Petascale computing is more complex than previous computing paradigms. New approaches for
    teaching and learning are required, and no single educational institution has the expertise and
    experience needed to fully exploit this extraordinary capability. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Preparation for petascale computing requires solid grounding in Computational Science and
    Engineering (CSE), HPC and HPC-related curricula. As a community, we must address the engagement
    of a larger and more diverse workforce to broaden participation and to ensure that CSE education
    keeps pace with the evolution of science and technology. We will leverage faculty expertise to
    establish best practices, identify and fill gaps, and modernize the CSE curriculum across all
    science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The goal is to engage undergraduate students in petascale computing research and education
    projects. Students selected through an application process will be provided with a full-year
    internship that includes summer and academic year support totaling $5,000. The students will
    become members of a petascale research group. The students will work within a research or
    education team, and will be provided multiple opportunities to interact with all of the other
    students during their internships. The NSF Blue Water Project will be funding 17 undergraduate
    research internships this year. This program provides for a $5,000 stipend for the student over
    the course of the year, travel, accommodations, meals and participation in a two week intensive
    Petascale Institute at the National Centre for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) and also
    travel to the SC11 conference in Seattle in November. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Students must be enrolled in an undergraduate institution. Students at all undergraduate
    institutions, as described above, are encouraged to apply. Under-represented students are
    strongly encouraged to apply.
