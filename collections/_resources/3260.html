description: "Python has gained tremendous popularity as a scripting language to glue together computationally heavy parts of a workflow or to perform pre- and postprocessing. For better or for worse, it is also increasingly used as a computational environment on its own using one or more of the many diverse open source python packages available. This Python in HPC session is a fair, evidence-based walk-through of techniques to make your Python scripts faster. Using a diffusion code as a working example, it will be shown how to effectively harness multiple threads and processes using the python packages such as numpy, numexpr, multiprocessing, and mpi4py."
