title: "Web Capacity Planning"
resource-url: "http://www.csce.uark.edu/~aapon/courses/capacityplanning/"
creator:
  - "Amy Apon"
description: "This course teaches a quantitative approach to analyzing client/server and Web-based systems. Students will learn how to develop performance predictive models for capacity planning. Instead of relying on intuition, ad hoc procedures, and rules of thumb, students will learn a uniform and formal way for dealing with performance problems. The performance models are based on the theory of queuing networks. By the end of the summer each student will complete, as part of a team, a performance capacity planning study on a real computing system."
