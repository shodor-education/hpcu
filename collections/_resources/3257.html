description: "The OpenACC presentation will focus on practical aspects of the OpenACC specification and how to implement a GPU code with directives. Aspects such as data movement, GPU routines with parallel loop and kernels directives, asynchronicity, and more advanced topics will be covered. However, the focus will be on the practical process of moving from a typical CPU-based code toward a refactored code that runs efficiently on GPUs. This will include aspects such as managing CPU threading, exposing threading, efficient test-driven development, portability concerns, and debugging. A small OpenACC code will also be used for hands-on training, and a larger code will also be made available for those with the desire to see OpenACC in a slightly more realistic application."
