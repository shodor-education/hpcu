description: "This module teaches the basic principles of semi-classical transport simulation based on the time-dependent Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) formalism with performance considerations for parallel implementations of multi-dimensional transport simulation and the numerical methods for efficient and accurate solution of the BTE for both electronic and thermal transport using the simple finite difference discretization and the stable upwind method."
