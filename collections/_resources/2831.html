title: "Problematic Patterns in Random Noise Learning Scenario"
resource-url: "http://shodor.org/talks-new/excel/problematicPatternsInRandomNoise/learningScenarioWeb/"
creator: "National Computational Science Institute"
description: "This system model calculates a series of random numbers and plots them on a graph with a line of best fit. The y-coordinate of the regression line, also known as y-hat or y&#770;, and the deviation from the observed value are also calculated and displayed on the spreadsheet. The model attempts to teach students the idea of error in any experiment and how to calculate how far detached the actual results are from hypothetical values. Students will learn how to interpret a residuals graph and apply these ideas to different experiments. In addition, they will learn when to use and when not to use a linear fit graph and how to infer from results whether linear regression was the right choice.
