description: "<p>
    D. E. Shaw Research is an independent research laboratory that conducts basic scientific
    research in the field of computational biochemistry. At present, the lab is involved primarily
    in the design of novel algorithms and machine architectures for high-speed molecular dynamics
    (MD) simulations of proteins and other biological macromolecules. The lab is also involved in
    the application of such simulations to basic scientific research in structural biology and
    biochemistry, and to the process of computer-aided drug design. Members of the lab include
    computational chemists and biologists, computer scientists and applied mathematicians, and
    computer architects and engineers, all working collaboratively within a tightly coupled
    interdisciplinary research environment.
