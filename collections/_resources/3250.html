description: "The first era of scientific computing was defined by Seymour Cray computers hosting single memory FORTRAN programs. In 1993, the first multicomputer with a thousand of independent and interconnected computers outperformed mono-memory supercomputers at 60 gigaflops. In 2019, supercomputers have millions of processing elements and operate at hundreds of petaflops. This performance gain of over two million changes not only the nature and scale of the science being simulated or analyzed, but also algorithms, design, and maintenance of the programs."
