    Funded by the Department of Energy Office of Science and National Nuclear Security
    Administration, the DOE CSGF trains scientists to meet the nation's workforce needs and helps to
    create a nationwide interdisciplinary community. The fellowship provides support and guidance to
    some of the nation's best scientific graduate students, and these graduates now work in DOE
    laboratories, private industry and educational institutions. Over 250 students at more than 50
    U.S. universities have trained as Fellows, and the demand is only growing.
