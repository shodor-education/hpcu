description: "This one-day workshop is intended to introduce life scientists to high performance computing at TACC. Attendees will learn how to utilize the vast array of resources that TACC offers for Computational Biology. Topics to be covered include computing, storage and visualization systems, life science software, basic Unix and compiling methods. A hands-on lab session will provide an opportunity to work with TACC systems directly. The class is intended for high performance computing \"novices\" and advanced computing skills are NOT required. A working knowledge of Unix is helpful but not necessary."
