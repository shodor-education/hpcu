  - "Niall Gaffney, TACC"
description: "This will be a high level overview of the various computing paradigms being covered during the institute, including CPUs, GPUs, and the programming models of MPI, OpenMP, Hyrbid, OpenACC, CUDA. The presenters will provide context for the benefits and differences of the various approaches to conducting computational analysis. For example, there will be an overview of GPUs covering basic GPU hardware introduction, heterogeneous computing concepts
GPU hardware introduction, trends, and futures."
