title: "Time to Science Learning Scenario"
resource-url: "http://shodor.org/talks-new/excel/timeToScience/learningScenarioWeb/"
creator: "National Computational Science Institute"
description: "Time-to-Science explores the benefits and detriments of increased parallel computing. The user is presented with two sliders that control the data load and the work load. The purpose and goal of the model is to optimize the time it takes to complete a task by finding the correct number of processors needed. An inverse linear relationship exists between the number of processors and processing time.
