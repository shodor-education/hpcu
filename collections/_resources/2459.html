url: "http://hpcuniversity.org/vscse/manycore/"
description: "This course explains why problem formulation and algorithm design choices can have dramatic effects on performance. Topics include locality, efficiency and vectorization in dense arrays, granularity coarsening, conversion from scatter to gather, parallelizing reductions, sorting and packing, and queue-based algorithms. Languages used are MPI+CUDA and MPI+OpenCL."
