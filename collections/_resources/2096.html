description: "A pattern language of parallel programming.  Design patterns give a name to recurring solutions experts take for granted in a problem domain.  These patterns can be organized into a web of interlocking of patterns that guide a designer from the beginning of a design problem to the end point; the realization of a design on real hardware.
Our Pattern language of parallel-software engineering will serve three distinct purposes: 
1. Education: Patterns have pedagogical value and help new parallel programmers more 
quickly master the field.  
2. Communication: Patterns give experts in parallel software design a common terminology to 
use as they advance the field. 
3. Design: Pattern of frameworks."
