description: "Scientists will often use a scalar model to demonstrate the interactions between two charged particles. This model uses a similar method with varying colors to depict the resulting vectors from the electromagnetic interactions between two particles. Users can change the charge and placements of each of the particles in order to see the effects of size and separation have on the particles' surrounding charge. Particle charges are broken up into x and y components, both of which are displayed on their own worksheet. When these two are superimposed, the resulting vector is displayed on the main screen.
