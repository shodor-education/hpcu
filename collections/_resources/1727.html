description: "Introduction to HPC architecture and performance issues. Compiler, communication, performance optimization and tools. Performance tools are software used to measure application performance usually with respect to execution time of all or portions of a code. These tools collect data from a running application that can be analyzed to determine if and where there are performance bottlenecks.

This tutorial gives an overview of the following commonly used performance tools:

    * Strace
    * Gprof
    * Perfsuite
    * TAU
