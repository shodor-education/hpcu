title: "Reaction Data Learning Scenario"
resource-url: "http://shodor.org/talks-new/excel/reactionData/learningScenarioWeb/"
creator: "National Computational Science Institute"
description: "This is a set of experimental data for a series of chemical reactions. It tracks the concentrations of reactants and products for four different reactions over the course of 100 time steps. Since reactions are not guaranteed to occur at precisely the same rate every time, this model includes data for four repetitions of the experiment for each of the reactions. The data in this model is already generated, so there are no parameters to manipulate; instead, users attempt to determine what the parameters used to generate the data were.
