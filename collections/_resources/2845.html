description: "This is a system model of the growth of a population of bunnies. It tracks the number of bunnies that are alive at each time step, and plots the results on a graph. Parameters in this model - birth rate, carrying capacity, and competition - determine how quickly the bunnies reproduce and their maximum population. When the model is run, it will display either exponential or asymptotic growth, depending on the parameters chosen. A graph displays the size of both populations of bunnies at each time step.
