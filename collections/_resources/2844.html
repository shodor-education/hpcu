description: "This is a system model of the spread of the disease in a population. It tracks the proportion of the population that is infected by the disease on any given day. The infection probability, recovery rate, loss of immunity fraction, birth rate, and death rate are user-controlled parameters. A graph depicts the change in the number of people who are susceptible, infected and recovered over the progression of the sickness.
