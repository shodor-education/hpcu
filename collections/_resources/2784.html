description: "Prerequisites: Parallel programming

In the shared-memory, heterogeneous environment that Stampede has on each node, it is much easier to introduce parallelism into your code with OpenMP than to do pthread programming from scratch or to use MPI. This module introduces OpenMP and describes how to use it."
