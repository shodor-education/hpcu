creator: "NCSI"
description: "This is a system model of the spread of a rumor throughout a population. The model tracks the number of different types of people within the population: gullibles, rumor mongerers, and loyalists. Parameters in the model - including spreading probability and rationality rate - determine the number of each type of individual in the population over time. When the model is run a graph is produced depicting the change in number of people who are gullibles, rumor mongerers, and loyalists over time.
