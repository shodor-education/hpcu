resource-url: "http://shodor.org/talks-new/vensim/communityCollege/learningScenarioWeb/"
creator: "NCSI"
description: "College graduation largely depends on how much time, effort, and class work one puts in. This model attempts to analyze the college experience to find the best plan to balance all factors that contribute to a student's graduation. Users of this model may move the sliders for several factors and see how they affect the enrollment levels at a community college. Students at this community college have a two-year track to graduation, and each year those who do not satisfactorily complete the requirements are cut. The goal of this model is to understand how all variables and commitments one has to their college affects whether or not they will graduate.
