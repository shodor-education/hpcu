title: "VSCSE Petascale Programming Environments and Tools"
resource-url: "http://hpcuniversity.org/vscse/petascale/"
description: "This course will introduce students to the challenges, opportunities, techniques, and resources for scaling computational science codes to perform on petascale computing systems. Students will learn techniques for coding and code optimization on highly parallel architectures, especially multicore architectures, debugging code in a highly parallel environment, scaling existing codes to highly parallel systems with thousands of cores, and developing parallel codes using numerical libraries, parallel I/O, and advanced compiler technologies."
