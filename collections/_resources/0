The NMPDR BRC contract ended in December 2009. At that time we ceased maintenance of the NMPDR web resource and data. The PATRIC team, located at the Virginia Bioinformatics Institute, created and maintains a new consolidated BRC for all of the NIAID category A-C priority pathogenic bacteria. NMPDR is transferring data and software associated to PATRIC for incorporation into their new Web-based bioinformatics resource. Please feel free to contact us if you have any questions about this transition."

    * The GridShib CA issues certificates based on Shibboleth authentication. The GridShib CA is now supported by the CILogon Project.

The following software is used by the TeraGrid Science Gateways program and is supported solely for that purpose. New adoption is not encouraged due to the Globus Project discontinuing development of the Java-based web services.

    * The GridShib SAML Tools bind SAML V1.1 assertions to RFC 3820 proxy certificates. The SAML Tools are used by the TeraGrid Science Gateways program and supported for that purpose.
    * GridShib for Globus Toolkit performs SAML-based authorization for Globus Toolkit 4.0 Java-based web services.

The following GridShib software is no longer supported:

    * GridShib for Shibboleth provides software plugins for the Shibboleth 2.0 Identity Provider (IdP) that implement the SAML V2.0 Holder-of-Key Web Browser SSO Profile."

creator: "PACS"
description: "(from the course site) There are a large number of applications that use the TCP and UDP protocols for development. This tutorial focuses on these applications and covers the basics of getting them to work well on high-performance networks. Highlighted are the different parameters you need to consider when:

* Developing new applications to run on high performance networks.
* Existing applications are tuned to run with maximum efficiency when ported to a high performance backbone.

This course also introduces a small set of system tools available to test network domain parameters such as connectivity and bandwidth, as well as some tools developed at NLANR (e.g. IPERF) that are used to measure the "jitters" in the network."

title: "Blue Waters Call for Undergraduate Student Applications for Internships"
url: "http://www.computationalscience.org/upep"
description: "<p>
   The NCSA Blue Waters project, in collaboration with the National Computational Science
    Institute (NCSI) and national HPC programs, is launching a coordinated effort to prepare current
    and future generations of students with the computational thinking skills, knowledge and
    commitment to advance scientific computing through the use of high performance computing (HPC)
    resources and environments. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Petascale computing is more complex than previous computing paradigms. New approaches for
    teaching and learning are required, and no single educational institution has the expertise and
    experience needed to fully exploit this extraordinary capability. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Preparation for petascale computing requires solid grounding in Computational Science and
    Engineering (CSE), HPC and HPC-related curricula. As a community, we must address the engagement
    of a larger and more diverse workforce to broaden participation and to ensure that CSE education
    keeps pace with the evolution of science and technology. We will leverage faculty expertise to
    establish best practices, identify and fill gaps, and modernize the CSE curriculum across all
    science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The goal is to engage undergraduate students in petascale computing research and education
    projects. Students selected through an application process will be provided with a full-year
    internship that includes summer and academic year support totaling $5,000. The students will
    become members of a petascale research group. The students will work within a research or
    education team, and will be provided multiple opportunities to interact with all of the other
    students during their internships. The NSF Blue Water Project will be funding 17 undergraduate
    research internships this year. This program provides for a $5,000 stipend for the student over
    the course of the year, travel, accommodations, meals and participation in a two week intensive
    Petascale Institute at the National Centre for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) and also
    travel to the SC11 conference in Seattle in November. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Students must be enrolled in an undergraduate institution. Students at all undergraduate
    institutions, as described above, are encouraged to apply. Under-represented students are
    strongly encouraged to apply.

creator: "Parallel Computing Laboratory at UC, Berkeley"
description: "A pattern language of parallel programming.  Design patterns give a name to recurring solutions experts take for granted in a problem domain.  These patterns can be organized into a web of interlocking of patterns that guide a designer from the beginning of a design problem to the end point; the realization of a design on real hardware.
Our Pattern language of parallel-software engineering will serve three distinct purposes: 
1. Education: Patterns have pedagogical value and help new parallel programmers more 
quickly master the field.  
2. Communication: Patterns give experts in parallel software design a common terminology to 
use as they advance the field. 
3. Design: Pattern of frameworks."

title: "Order from Chaos: A Sampling of Stochastic Optimization Algorithms"
url: "http://shodor.org/petascale/materials/UPModules/StochOpt/"
creator: "David Joiner"
description: "This teaching module introduces stochastic approaches to finding optimum solutions for adequately defined systems. Because these approaches are intrinsically random, large numbers of random samples are typically required to find robust optima. This results in either long single simulation runs, or the need for multiple replicated simulations considered as an ensemble, or both. Monte Carlo, simulated annealing and genetic algorithm approaches to optimization are introduced in this module and applied to a few example problems, and parallelization strategies and their resulting performance gains are assessed."

title: "Serial Code Optimization"
url: "http://www.hector.ac.uk/cse/documentation/SerialOpt/"
description: "This guide presents the main features of serial optimisation for computationally intensive codes with a focus on the HECToR computing resources. From a user point of view, two main avenues can be followed when trying to optimise an application. One type of optimisations DO NOT involve modifying the source code (modification may not be desirable); optimisation consists of searching for the best compiler, set of flags and libraries. Another type of optimisations DO involve modifying the source code; in the first instance the programmer must evaluate if a new algorithm is necessary, followed by writing or rewriting optimised code. According to the these choices this guide presents optimisation as a problem of compiler and library selection, followed by a presentation of the key factors that must be considered when writing numerically intensive code."

title: "Parallel Optimisation"
url: "http://www.hector.ac.uk/cse/documentation/ParallelOpt/"
description: "An introduction to optimisation techniques that may improve parallel performance and scaling on HECToR. It assumes that the reader has some experience of parallel programming including basic MPI and OpenMP. Scaling is a measurement of the ability for a parallel code to use increasing numbers of cores efficiently. A scalable application is one that, when the number of processors is increased, performs better by a factor which justifies the additional resource employed. Making a parallel application scale to many thousands of processes requires not only careful attention to the communication, data and work distribution but also to the choice of the algorithms to use. Since the choice of algorithm is too broad a subject and very particular to application domain to include in this brief guide we concentrate on general good practices towards parallel optimisation on HECToR."

url: "http://www.hector.ac.uk/cse/documentation/Debugging/"
description: "The purpose of this guide is to introduce some tools and techniques that are generally applicable. By far the most popular debugging tool is the print statement. The idea is to produce a commentary of what your program is doing and deduce where the program fails from the point at which output stops and understand why it fails from the values of printed variables. Another important ally is the compiler; changing compilation options can often reveal bugs. More sophisticated (but sometimes no more effective) tools are also available such as the GNU Debugger (GDB) and proprietary tools such as TotalView (which is available on HECToR). These tools allow programmers to stop their programs at specified points, inspect variables and step through code line-by-line."

description: "In this lab exercise, you will parallelize some simple algorithms using shared memory programming (OpenMP) and distributed memory programming (MPI) simultaneously. While the first two examples provide a simple introduction, the third one is concerned with the hybridization of a code for solving Poisson's equation on a 2D domain using Jacobi iteration. Your task is to experimentally investigate the performance of the hybrid code and compare it to pure OpenMP and MPI codes. If you are interested in a more advanced application, the NAS Parallel Benchmark (multi-zone) is provided in order to test a more advanced code. You will use Ferlin parallel system in these experiment."

description: "The purpose of this workshop is to discuss fault-tolerance (FT) on large systems for running large, possibly long-running applications. The main point of the workshop is to have systems people, middleware people (include FT experts), and apps people talk about the issues and figure out what needs to be done, mostly at the middleware and app levels, to run such apps on the coming petascale systems, without having faults that cause large numbers of application failures. The workshop was held during March 19-20, 2009."

description: "The purpose of this tutorial is to provide a basic introduction to the use of Mathematica as a programming language for writing scientific simulations, with a particular focus on simulating stochastic processes. The tutorial assumes a basic familiarity with the use of Mathematica, including the basic syntax, graphics commands, and use of functions.  Some experience with a conventional "procedural" programming language, such as BASIC, Pascal, or C, is also assumed. Examples in Pascal or procedural "pseudocode" will be provided, to highlight the differences in programming philosophy and methodolgy between these languages and Mathematica."

title: "PhET - Interactive Simulations"
url: "http://phet.colorado.edu/"
description: "PhET provides fun, interactive, research-based simulations of physical phenomena for free. To help students visually comprehend concepts, PhET simulations animate what is invisible to the eye through the use of graphics and intuitive controls such as click-and-drag manipulation, sliders and radio buttons. In order to further encourage quantitative exploration, the simulations also offer measurement instruments including rulers, stop-watches, voltmeters and thermometers. As the user manipulates these interactive tools, responses are immediately animated thus effectively illustrating cause-and-effect relationships as well as multiple linked representations (motion of the objects, graphs, number readouts, etc.)"

title: "VSCSE Big Data for Science"
url: "http://hpcuniversity.org/vscse/bigdata/"
description: "Humans are generating, sensing, and harvesting massive amounts of digital data, and many of these unprecedentedly large data sets will be archived in their entirety. The familiar notions of sequential or random access files no longer apply in the cloud. Instead developers will write code that mines this mass of unstructured data, extracts what is of interest, and then inserts the resulting data subset into a relational database or other structured data store where it will be analyzed and visualized. In a data-intensive world where the sheer volume of data demands new approaches and techniques, the inclination is to move the computation to the data, a basic theme underlying this course. Called the "fourth paradigm" (after theory, experiment, and computation), data-intensive computing is poised to transform scientific research. Students will learn about the notion of "data at rest" and its impact on data movement and computation, the role of cloud infrastructure in data-intensive computing, and the need for semantic metadata, preservation, and curation of digital data. Participants will get hands-on programming experience with data-intensive computing languages such as MapReduce."

creator: "Rob Hochberg"
description: "This module provides a quick review of dynamic programming, but the student is assumed to have seen it before. The parallel programming environment is NVIDIA's CUDA environment for graphics cards (GPGPU - general purpose graphics processing units). The CUDA environment simultaneously operates with a fast shared memory and a much slower global memory, and thus has aspects of shared-memory parallel computing and distributed computing. Specifics for programming in CUDA are included where appropriate, but the reader is also referred to the NVIDIA CUDA C Programming Guide, and the CUDA API Reference Manual."

creator: "Rob Hochberg"
description: "This module is largely stand-alone. It is "Part II" only in the sense that it does not contain the overview of dynamic programming seen in Part I, and does not recapitulate the introduction to CUDA. We will continue to refer the reader to various NVIDIA references where appropriate, particularly the NVIDIA CUDA C Programming Guide, and the CUDA API Reference Manual, and where we introduce new CUDA-specific ideas, will linger a bit longer by way of introduction. The algorithms described here are completely independent of Part I, so that a reader who already has some familiarity with CUDA and dynamic programming may begin with this module with little difficulty."

description: "This teaching module continues with a demonstration of parallel and high-performance computing applied to the simulation of n-body system with a consideration of the issues that arise and approaches that are used to scale the such simulations.

An initial introduction into GalaxSee HPC is covered in part I of the GalaxSee HPC modules. Part II will focus on numerical issues related to solving the N-Body problem more efficiently, in particular the use of softened potentials in the force calculation, the use of tree-based methods such as the Barnes-Hut method, and the use of spectral methods such as the Particle-Mesh method. Some of the mathematics involved can be performed by a student with a solid basis in algebra; however the theory behind the Particle-Mesh method does assume some knowledge of partial differential equations and of the use of Fourier transforms to simplify the solution of PDEs with periodic boundary conditions."

In hybrid programming, the goal is to combine techniques from OpenMP and MPI to create a high-performance parallel code that is better tailored for the non-uniform and heterogeneous memory access characteristics of Stampede. To meet this goal, it is necessary to understand the effects of processor affinity and memory allocation policy, and to exert some control over them."

description: "This tutorial provides a comprehensive introduction to using the Message Passing Interface (MPI). MPI is a a standard library of subroutines (Fortran) or function calls (C) used to implement the message-passing parallel programming model. MPI allows for the coordination of a program running as multiple processes in a distributed memory environment, yet is also flexible enough to be used in a shared memory system. The standardization of the MPI library enables source code portability and efficient implementations across a range of architectures."

title: "Dominant Recessive Sampling Learning Scenario"

creator: "National Computational Science Institute"
description: "This is a simple system model that demonstrates passing on a recessive allele to one's offspring. Genotypes from parents are calculated via random numbers, which consequently determine the expression (or lack thereof) of the recessive allele in their kid. If, by random chance, both parents pass on the recessive allele, their kid will exhibit that recessive trait. This can be tied to the inheritance of recessive genetic disorders in real life. When one recessive trait is very rare, the chance of it being expressed is also rare, since the dominant allele will always "hide" the recessive. There are no inputs for this model, but it may be run multiple times to gain a better understanding of the concepts surrounding allelic patterns."

The y-coordinate of the regression line, also known as y-hat or y&#770;, and the deviation from the observed value are also calculated and displayed on the spreadsheet. The model attempts to teach students the idea of error in any experiment and how to calculate how far detached the actual results are from hypothetical values. Students will learn how to interpret a residuals graph and apply these ideas to different experiments. In addition, they will learn when to use and when not to use a linear fit graph and how to infer from results whether linear regression was the right choice.

title: "Pseudo Random Numbers Learning Scenario"
url: "http://shodor.org/talks-new/excel/pseudoRandomNumbers/learningScenarioWeb/"
creator: "National Computational Science Institute"
description: "Random numbers on computers are almost never "true" random numbers. That is, since the computer calculates its random numbers through a series of algorithms, even if it is hard to detect a pattern, the numbers are not genuinely random. This model allows for students to explore what is known as "pseudo random numbers" and the algorithms that run behind such calculations. Through a series of shifts, multipliers, and other calculations, random numbers are generated and used to estimate the area under a curve. The integral calculated in this model is the area of the unit circle, equal to pi. Many trials yield a more accurate result, as the Law of Large Numbers states, so the model takes into account increasing amounts of random numbers to calculate pi.

title: "Reaction Data Learning Scenario"
url: "http://shodor.org/talks-new/excel/reactionData/learningScenarioWeb/"
creator: "National Computational Science Institute"
description: "This is a set of experimental data for a series of chemical reactions. It tracks the concentrations of reactants and products for four different reactions over the course of 100 time steps. Since reactions are not guaranteed to occur at precisely the same rate every time, this model includes data for four repetitions of the experiment for each of the reactions. The data in this model is already generated, so there are no parameters to manipulate; instead, users attempt to determine what the parameters used to generate the data were.

creator: "National Computational Science Institute"
description: "This is a system model of salt diffusion in water. Each of the cells starts with a certain concentration of salt, and then changes its concentration each time step based on the concentration of salt in all adjacent cells. Because the outer edge of the cellblock is considered permanently zero (representing a large body of water), salt will slowly diffuse down to zero, beginning at the edges and progressing into the middle. Users can set the initial concentration, and then step through the simulation.

creator: "NCSI"
description: "This is a system model of an enzyme reaction. In this reaction, each reactant molecule must bind to an enzyme molecule in order to become a product. Enzymes can only bind to one reactant at a time and take a fixed amount of time to convert it to a product, so the concentration of enzymes is the limiting factor for the reaction. The transformations of reactant and enzyme into enzyme-reactant complex, and enzyme-reactant complex into enzyme and product, are defined by the Michaelis-Menton equation. Parameters in this model determine the inputs to the equation, which in turn determine the rate of the reaction.

creator: "NCSI"
description: "This is a more complicated population model that includes two different groups - predators and prey. The population of prey in the model grows exponentially according to its birth fraction and death proportionality constant, while the population of predators in the model grows or shrinks based on the population of its prey alongside its birth rate and death proportionality constant. The result is to create one of two states for the model. It is possible for the populations to reach equilibrium where the number of predators and prey remains roughly stable over time, but it is also possible for one or both species to die out. Users can set the initial populations, the rules governing reproduction for both species, and the death rates of both species.

title: "Learning Scenario - Projectile Motion (Vensim)"
url: "http://shodor.org/talks-new/vensim/projectileMotion/learningScenarioWeb/"
creator: "NCSI"
description: "Most high school physics classes will cover projectile motion, but few proceed to calculate the force of air resistance and its effect on the path that the object takes in the air. This model factors in the extra variable of drag and displays the displacement, momentum, and net force over time. Initially, the force is constant, the momentum decreases linearly, and the displacement over time is parabolic. Students will find that they can manipulate the shapes of the graph by increasing the drag, mass, and initial momentum. This model attempts to lead students one step farther using calculus to extend the ideas of physics.

url: "http://shodor.org/talks-new/vensim/reversibleConsecutiveFirstOrderReactions/learningScenarioWeb/"
creator: "NCSI"
description: "This model represents a two-stage reversible reaction. Many organic processes operate in which the reaction can both transform reactants to products, and products back to reactants. In such a scenario, rather than going to completion the reaction will reach equilibrium. There are three stages in the reaction, represented by groups A, B, and C. As time goes by, A transforms to B, and B to C, and upon equilibrium the reverse can also occur

description: "This is a system model of the spread of a rumor throughout a population. The model tracks the number of different types of people within the population: gullibles, rumor mongerers, and loyalists. Parameters in the model - including spreading probability and rationality rate - determine the number of each type of individual in the population over time. When the model is run a graph is produced depicting the change in number of people who are gullibles, rumor mongerers, and loyalists over time.

url: "http://shodor.org/talks-new/vensim/simpleFunctionModel/learningScenarioWeb/"
creator: "NCSI"
description: "This model is a graphing simulation with a function and variables that can be changed dynamically. Users may edit the value for each variable that plugs into the graphed equation and see its effect on the function's graph. The Simple Function model is a good introduction to algebraic concepts and the idea of a function. By comparing the variables' values and their role in the function itself, students will be able to see how each variable has an effect on the graphical trends of a function.

title: "Learning Scenario - Sociology 101 (Vensim)"
url: "http://shodor.org/talks-new/vensim/sociology101/learningScenarioWeb/"
creator: "NCSI"
description: "The Sociology 101 model focuses on the mood of people within a society. The population consists of two groups, the Passives and the Agressives, and people can switch between the two. While randomness essentially governs the variation within the model, variables also control how many citizens are passive and how many are aggressive. Based on user-set values, these variables can affect how many citizens wind up in each group. A graph displays the change in mood over time, which is a tool that could be useful for political leaders who wish to survey and respond to citizens' mood. Students using this model will be able to study and evaluate factors that decide a population's mood as well as discuss the applications and modern methods for determining it.

creator: "Kim Dillman"
description: "Scientific workflows allow users to easily express multi-step computational tasks, for example retrieve data from an instrument or a database, reformat the data, and run an analysis. A scientific workflow describes the dependencies between the tasks and in most cases the workflow is described as a directed acyclic graph (DAG), where the nodes are tasks and the edges denote the task dependencies. A defining property for a scientific workflow is that it manages data flow. The tasks in a scientific workflow can be everything from short serial tasks to very large parallel tasks (MPI for example) surrounded by a large number of small, serial tasks used for pre- and post-processing."

description: "C++ is a powerful language used in in a number of extensible numerical software libraries.  Its multi-paradigm feature set allows for a number of applications without sacrificing the performance that low-level code can provide.  While C++ is often characterized as an \\\"experts-only\\\" language, the basic features are both accessible to novices and provide useful abstractions for any code. Our class will be broken into a morning session on basic language syntax, e.g., control flow, IO, and objects.  The afternoon session will focus on intermediate features, e.g., memory management, templates, and the STL.  Our examples will largely be drawn from scientific computing codes and each session will include a lab with help getting started. Prerequisite: Basic unix skills will be assumed and some programming knowledge would be beneficial."

title: "Man v. Machine: The Challenge of Engineering Programs for HPC"
url: "https://youtu.be/hgGSeoUDm78"
creator: "Gordon Bell"
description: "The first era of scientific computing was defined by Seymour Cray computers hosting single memory FORTRAN programs. In 1993, the first multicomputer with a thousand of independent and interconnected computers outperformed mono-memory supercomputers at 60 gigaflops. In 2019, supercomputers have millions of processing elements and operate at hundreds of petaflops. This performance gain of over two million changes not only the nature and scale of the science being simulated or analyzed, but also algorithms, design, and maintenance of the programs."

description: "OpenMP is the defacto directive-based parallel programming API to program applications on shared memory and accelerator architectures. It can be used to program types of parallelism including loop worksharing, tasking, offloading, fine-grain SIMD, SPMD, etc. In this session, we will introduce the basic OpenMP program structure, the major components, how threads are created and used to share work in the parallel regions. We will cover the basics of OpenMP data environment and memory model, and concepts in optimizing data locality and thread affinity. 

We will also discuss the following topics in more details: Parallelizing regular loops with workshare directives as it is one of the most important usage patterns in OpenMP. We will also cover OpenMP tasks to parallelize irregular computations, the SIMD directive to aid compiler vectorization for loops and the target construct used for offloading computational intensive kernels to accelerators."

description: "The OpenACC presentation will focus on practical aspects of the OpenACC specification and how to implement a GPU code with directives. Aspects such as data movement, GPU routines with parallel loop and kernels directives, asynchronicity, and more advanced topics will be covered. However, the focus will be on the practical process of moving from a typical CPU-based code toward a refactored code that runs efficiently on GPUs. This will include aspects such as managing CPU threading, exposing threading, efficient test-driven development, portability concerns, and debugging. A small OpenACC code will also be used for hands-on training, and a larger code will also be made available for those with the desire to see OpenACC in a slightly more realistic application."

title: "PCI 2019 - HPC Python Programming"
url: "https://youtu.be/yMRVmcs8Vdo"
creator: "Ramses van Zon, SciNet, University of Toronto"
description: "Python has gained tremendous popularity as a scripting language to glue together computationally heavy parts of a workflow or to perform pre- and postprocessing. For better or for worse, it is also increasingly used as a computational environment on its own using one or more of the many diverse open source python packages available. This Python in HPC session is a fair, evidence-based walk-through of techniques to make your Python scripts faster. Using a diffusion code as a working example, it will be shown how to effectively harness multiple threads and processes using the python packages such as numpy, numexpr, multiprocessing, and mpi4py."

description: "To truly take advantage of all the benefits of an HPC system, it is important to understand how to properly optimize your code. To properly optimize code, there needs to be an understanding of how compilers, debuggers, and profilers work in conjunction to improve your code's performance. By combining these three tools together we can achieve an optimized software stack to solve our science."

title: "PCI 2019 - Parallel I/0 Best Practices"
url: "https://youtu.be/cPbM7NkfoOU"
creator: "Robert Latham, Argonne National Laboratory"
description: "High-performance computing turns compute challenges into I/O challenges. In this talk we will survey the I/O libraries and tools available to computational scientists to effectively meet their data challenges. MPI-IO provides a foundation for higher-level libraries, so we'll spend a bit of time discussing the optimizations available. Then we will cover Parallel-NetCDF and HDF5, two of the more popular application-oriented libraries. Finally we will discuss the Darshan characterization tool to help make sense of what is going on behind the scenes with your application's I/O requests."

title: "PCI 2019 - Containers in HPC"
url: "https://youtu.be/5kRQ6v_x7m4"
creator: "Joe Allen, TACC"
description: "Docker and Singularity are a products for delivering container solutions. Containers help in standardizing the process of packaging software and the associated dependencies such that the issues related to the differences in environment (e.g., different versions of the libraries) during the development and release phases of a software can be mitigated. In doing so, Containers simplify the software installation processes by providing an easy way to share working environments, which in turn makes it easy to use libraries with complicated setups. Distributing a Docker or Singularity image means distributing both the code itself as well as the environment used to run that code allowing images to run identically on OSX, Windows, and Linux, so generated analyses will run on any other machine and will have reproducible results."

title: "Making Containers Easier with HPC Container Maker | Scott McMillan"
url: "http://youtu.be/8VA3EqzKnVk"
creator: "Scott McMillan, Senior Solutions Architect at NVIDIA"
description: "Containers make it possible for scientists and engineers to easily use portable and reproducible software environments. However, if the desired application is not already available from a container registry, generating a custom container image from scratch can be challenging for users accustomed to a bare metal software environment. HPC Container Maker (HPCCM) is an open source project to address these challenges. HPCCM provides a high level, configurable Python recipe format for deploying HPC components into container images according to best practices. HPCCM recipes are more portable and powerful than native container specification formats, easier to create, and produce smaller, well-constructed container images."
