description: "The mission of the Scientific Visualization Studio is to facilitate scientific inquiry and
    outreach within NASA programs through visualization. To that end, the SVS works closely with
    scientists in the creation of visualization products, systems, and processes in order to promote
    a greater understanding of Earth and Space Science research activities at Goddard Space Flight
    Center and within the NASA research community."

      text: "NASAs Space Visualization Studio is one of the must comprehensive visualization sites available. These visualizations are both 2D and 3D and are of course predominantly of the Earth and other astronomical objects. Imagery is classified by keyword, insrument, series, scientist, or animator, with detailed explanations of each visualization. What seems to be lacking is an introduction to the basics of scientific visualization."
      usability: "Very usable"
