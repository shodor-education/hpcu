description: "Linked Environments for Atmospheric Discovery (LEAD) makes meteorological data, forecast models, and analysis and visualization tools available to anyone who wants to interactively explore the weather as it evolves. The LEAD Portal brings together all the necessary resources at one convenient access point, supported by high-performance computing systems. With LEAD, meteorologists, researchers, educators, and students are no longer passive bystanders or limited to static data or pre-generated images, but rather they are active participants who can acquire and process their own data."
