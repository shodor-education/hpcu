description: "This is a model of the interactions between five populations - princes, frogs, princesses, sleeping beauties, and witches. As the simulation runs, witches transform princes into frogs and princesses into sleeping beauties, while princes can transform sleeping beauty's back into a princess and princesses turn frogs back to princes. The total number of princes and frogs, princesses and sleeping beauties, and witches are fixed; members of the populations can be converted to members of other populations, but there is no birth or death.
