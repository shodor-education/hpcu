description: "Scientific software has emerged as an essential discipline in its own right. Because computational models, computer architectures, and scientific software projects have become extremely complex, the Computational Science & Engineering (CSE) community now has a unique opportunity to address pressing challenges in scientific software productivity, quality, and sustainability. This presentation will focus on software engineering best practices and efforts in the CSE community to foster natural incentives for improving software quality on the way to improving computational science."
