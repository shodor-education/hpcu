title: "LaPlace Equation Learning Scenario"
resource-url: "http://shodor.org/talks-new/excel/laplaceEquation/learningScenarioWeb/"
creator:
  - "National Computational Science Institute"
description: "This model illustrates and animates the movement of an oscillating surface, such as a drumhead being struck, using the Laplace Relaxation Method. The center four cells are the source of the oscillation, and as they vibrate up and down, the surrounding cells dampen the effect. A 3-D animation with clear axes labels shows the movement of the cells. The user can speed up or slow down the animation as it runs to better visualize the movement.
