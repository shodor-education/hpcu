title: "Lesson Scenario - Generic Chemical Dynamics (Vensim)"
url: "http://shodor.org/talks-new/vensim/genericChemicalDynamics/learningScenarioWeb/"
creator: "NCSI"
description: "This is a simple dynamics model of generic chemical reaction relationships. The reactions model consists of three compounds - the reactant, an intermediate compound, and the product. As the model progresses, reactants change into intermediaries, which then change to products. The results of this model simply show how reactants change upon reactions. Users can change the parameter of reactions 1 and 2 to view the rates of transformation.
