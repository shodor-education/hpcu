description: "OpenMP is the defacto directive-based parallel programming API to program applications on shared memory and accelerator architectures. It can be used to program types of parallelism including loop worksharing, tasking, offloading, fine-grain SIMD, SPMD, etc. In this session, we will introduce the basic OpenMP program structure, the major components, how threads are created and used to share work in the parallel regions. We will cover the basics of OpenMP data environment and memory model, and concepts in optimizing data locality and thread affinity. 

We will also discuss the following topics in more details: Parallelizing regular loops with workshare directives as it is one of the most important usage patterns in OpenMP. We will also cover OpenMP tasks to parallelize irregular computations, the SIMD directive to aid compiler vectorization for loops and the target construct used for offloading computational intensive kernels to accelerators."
